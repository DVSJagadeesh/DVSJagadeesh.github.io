## Summary
Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Large Language Models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. I combine strong research foundations with hands-on system building, with three IEEE publications and practical experience applying ML and NLP to real-world problems. Passionate about designing intelligent systems that bridge research and industry.

## Education
* **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** (Sept 2021 - July 2025)
  * *Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University*
  * CGPA: 8.65, First Class with Distinction.
* **Exchange Program** (Feb 2025 - July 2025)
  * *University of Twente*
  * Engineered a Beyond-Vanilla RAG system using a custom Knowledge Graph (NetworkX/GML) and Hybrid Semantic Search (FAISS) to enable multi-hop reasoning over historical narratives.
  * Developed sophisticated Memory Orchestration pipelines including entity-centric query expansion and NLP-driven topic extraction to provide high-quality, long-context awareness to Gemini 1.5 Pro.
  * Optimized the intersection of Structured Memory (Knowledge Graphs) and Unstructured Data to improve narrative faithfulness and reduce hallucinations in streaming LLM environments.

## Technical Skills
* **Core:** Data Structures & Algorithms, Agile Software Development
* **AI/ML:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, RAG Systems
* **Tools/Tech:** TensorFlow, SQL

## Leadership & Experience
* **Area G3 Director** (2024 - 2025)
  * *Toastmasters International*
  * Served five corporate clubs with ~130 professionals and leaders across the industry.
  * Organized Feb 2024 Leadership Conclave with a team of four, over the course of three months, securing a keynote address and two executive-led panel discussions in a corporate venue.

## Publications 
* **Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis from Patients Speech Analysis (IEEE)**
  * Used multiple learning algorithms to detect Parkinson's disease from patient speech analysis. Achieved 95% diagnostic accuracy with Random Forest and XGBoost on the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset (197 instances, 22 features). Used SHAP to identify the top 6 most influential features.
* **Deep Learning-Based Analysis of Pediatric Pneumonia Detection in Children using Fine-tuned NasNetMobile Model (IEEE)**
  * Performed a comparative study on CNN architectures for pediatric pneumonia detection. Fine-tuned NasNetMobile with Mish activation, batch normalization, and dropout on a chest X-ray dataset of 5,232 images, achieving an F-score of 92%.
* **Comparative Image Analysis of Chest X-RAY Image Encryption using Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption Algorithms (IEEE)**
  * Explored multilayer encryption strategies for medical image protection. Compared, and analyzed AES and DES encryption with RSA and DSS digital signatures on chest X-rays. AES with RSA yielded the best performance in decryption speed while ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication (CIA).
